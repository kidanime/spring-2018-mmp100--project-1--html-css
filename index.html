During his junior year of high school Satoru developed his own games on his HP-56 the first programmable claculator several games he produced were simple number games such as, volleyball and Missile Attack. His first computer that he had was a Commodore PET which he dismantaled it to study how to works. Coincidentally the computer had the same central processing unit that the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) had that he would later devlop games for.

<p>In 2000 Satoru Iwata took a position at Nintendo as the head of its corporate planning division and took a seat on the board of directors two years later wehn Yamauchi, the company's president since 1949, retired from Nintendo on MAY 24, 2002. Iwata became the fourth president of the Nintendo company with yamauchi final request  "that Nintendo give birth to wholly new ideas and create hardware which reflects that ideal. And make software that adheres to that same standard." at the time of his promotion Nintendo wasn't performing as wel as the other console  makers, with GameCube doing poorly and Sony's playstation 2 and Microsoft'S XBOX outselling the others Satoru took cautions when approching the issue.Few years passed and Iwata invented the Nintendo DS,DS Lite, DSI,the WII,WII U,and the Nintendo Switch. By July 11, 2015 Satoru Iwata died due to compications from a tumor at age 55. </p>


<p>The reason why Satoru Iwata is interesting to me is because he is what I inspire to be one day. He helped create games that we all love and remember like SUPER SMASH BROS. ,KIRBY, THE LEGEND OF ZELDA, and even the most favorite POKEMON. There are more games that he created and consoles that he thought or help develop and even though he passed on he will live on in his creation and in the hearts of the gaming community.</p>
